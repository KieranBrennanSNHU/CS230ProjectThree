# CS230ProjectThree

The client for the draw it or lose it is the Gaming Room. They wanted a game devleoped that would propegate an image and then the user would draw it and their teammate would try to guess what it is. I think I chose the right OS for this particular project as Windows is the most common and most acssesible for users. I liked using the design document becuse it helped make the whole process cohesive. I could see what we were going to work on next and start thinking about it. I would improve the design constaints section so that I can get a better understanding of the details of constraints. I would imnprove it by reasearching contraints in more detail. When considering the user's needs we decided that our gaem had to work on many different instances and OS. I broke the design into sections and worked on them independently until I had to bring them together, this allowed me to go at a pace I was comfortable with and not get overwhelmed.
